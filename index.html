            <p class = "primaryText">It has come to our attention that within the country 
                there lives a being named “Alan Red”. With insider 
                information courtesy of “Glep”, who works at the 
                “Smiling Friends” charity with Alan, we have discovered 
                some damning actions. First, Alan has been stockpiling 
                various handguns, assault weapons, etc. We do not know 
                where exactly these weapons are located, but we suspect 
                they are hidden in a building a mile down from his apartments. 
                We have not raided this area yet as doing so could lead to a 
                dangerous scramble and panic on part of Alan.</p>
